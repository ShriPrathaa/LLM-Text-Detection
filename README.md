# LLM-Text-Detection
Detecting AI generated text is one field of ML where there has been an extensive contribution from academia than the industry. In fact, OpenAI which had published its open source AI generated text detector had removed it owing to it not being satisfied with the accuracy of the classifier. Primary ground work I have done are models using comparison of log probability of original text with its perturbations at low temperature(DetectGPT) and deep learning model transfer. Extracting various features such as word frequencies, sentence lengths, and syntactic structures and performing boosting/ SVMs remain ofcourse the primitive steps. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to this field, with the goal of bringing about a substantial breakthrough
